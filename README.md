### <h1 align="center">Hi 👋 My name is Sercan KURBAN</h1>

### <h3 align="center">I'm a Software Developer</h3>

I gratuated from Bartin University Department of Management Information Systems in June 2020. After the software courses I took at school, my interest in software started and when I finished school, I continued to focus on this field. This training is ISKUR supported Web and Mobile Programming (800 hours) training. During the training period, I learned C#, ASP.Net, MVC, .Net Core, HTML, CSS, SQL languages and developed projects in this way. As a result of the training, software developer certificates were given by Microsoft, MEB and ISKUR. I am a quick learner and have a strong attention to detail. I can quickly solve problems that I encounter. I look forward to continuing to expand my skills and knowledge in software development.
